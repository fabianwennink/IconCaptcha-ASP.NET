Introducing IconCaptcha, a self-hosted captcha solution that's designed to be fast, user-friendly, and highly customizable. Unlike other captchas, IconCaptcha spares users the need of deciphering hard-to-read text images, solving complex math problems, or engaging with perplexing puzzle games. Instead, with IconCaptcha it's as straightforward as comparing up to 8 icons and selecting the least common one.

IconCaptcha doesn't just prioritize users; it's also developer-friendly. In just a few steps, you can have IconCaptcha integrated into your website. Even if you're new to ASP.NET and JavaScript, installing IconCaptcha is a straightforward process. The included demo pages in this repository provide all the necessary code to get IconCaptcha up and running. For more in-depth insights, take a moment to explore the information provided on this page and the wiki.

## Installation

Package Manager: `Install-Package IconCaptcha`   
.NET CLI: `dotnet add package IconCaptcha`

Once the package has been installed, continue with the remaining [setup instructions](https://github.com/fabianwennink/IconCaptcha-ASP.NET/wiki).

## Features
* __User Friendly:__ The captcha uses easily understandable images instead of hard to read texts to complete the captcha.
* __Server-side Validation:__ All validation done by the captcha will be performed on the server-side instead of the client-side.
* __Self Hosted:__ Because IconCaptcha is a self-hosted plugin, you are not relying on any third party.
* __No Data Sharing:__ Unlike captchas such as Google ReCaptcha, no user data will be stored or sold to third parties.
* __jQuery Support:__ IconCaptcha is written in plain JavaScript, but hooks into jQuery to allow you to integrate it in your jQuery code.
* __Modern Design:__ The look and feel of IconCaptcha fits every modern website design.
* __Events:__ Events are triggered at various points in the code, allowing you to hook into them and execute custom code if necessary.
* __Themes:__ Select the design of the captcha without having to ever touch a stylesheet, or create your own custom theme.
* __SASS:__ The project contains a SASS file, allowing you to easily style and compile the stylesheet.
